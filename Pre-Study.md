# **📚 Pre-Study: The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs**

Instructions:  
Before Class 2 begins, please read the provided article ["The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs"](https://www.shopdev.co/blog/data-science-hierarchy-of-needs) . Then, use NotebookLM to deepen your understanding.

## **🤖 NotebookLM Prompt Guide**

Upload the article to NotebookLM and try these prompts:

### **1\. The Core Definitions**

"Based on this text, what is the clear difference between **Data Analytics**, **Data Science**, and **AI**? Create a comparison table showing the 'Goal', 'Typical Tools', and 'Output' for each."

### **2\. The Pyramid Analogy**

"Why is this model called a 'Hierarchy of Needs'? Explain the analogy to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Why can't we do AI/Deep Learning without first doing 'Data Collection'?"

### **3\. Self-Assessment**

"Quiz me on the different levels of the pyramid. Ask me 3 questions, one by one, and correct me if I'm wrong."

## **📝 Preparation for Class**

Be ready to discuss:

* *Why do most companies fail when they try to jump straight to AI?*  
* *Where do you think our '1 Million Row' project fits in this hierarchy?*
